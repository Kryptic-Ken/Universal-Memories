This place is completely shrouded in darkness and is a dumping ground for the negative energy from being from the 12 universe. That is where the Dark One is from. The Dark One is ebing nearly omnipotent being who draws his powers from the Negative Zone. He has come to rule over all universes, but he has issued a challenge to you specically. He wishes to test you for some reason. But you can't just go see him.\nAs his herald, I will inform you of this challenge. I pointed out earlier that you dont seem to know who you are; the Dark One took all of your memories and fragmented into 12 pieces. He has placed each piece in a universe for you to find, but you will encounter challenges in each universe. You may pickup weapons along the way to defeat your enemies and reclaim your memories. Once you have reclaimed all 12 memory fragments, you will be able to challenge the Dark One is his palace. I will alert you of certain accomplishments along your journey.
